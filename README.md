## Using Proton-J over AMQP 1.0 with Solace Message Routers

The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware, and Solace Message Routers support AMQP 1.0.

In addition to information provided on the Solace [Developer Portal](http://dev.solace.com/tech/amqp/), you may also look at external sources for more details about AMQP:

 - http://www.amqp.org
 - https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=amqp
 - http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-complete-v1.0.pdf

The "Getting Started" tutorials will get you up to speed and sending messages with Solace technology as quickly as possible. There are two ways you can get started:

- If your company has Solace message routers deployed, contact your middleware team to obtain the host name or IP address of a Solace message router to test against, a username and password to access it, and a VPN in which you can produce and consume messages.
- If you do not have access to a Solace message router, you will need to go through the “[Set up a VMR](http://docs.solace.com/Solace-VMR-Set-Up/Setting-Up-VMRs.htm)” tutorial to download and install the software.
